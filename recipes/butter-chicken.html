    <h2>Description Of This Dish</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.</p>
        <p>Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

         </ul>   
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Marinate the chicken:</h3></li>     
        <p>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.</p>  
        <p>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</p>
            <li><h3>Soak cashews and almonds:</h3></li>
            <p>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.</p>
            <li><h3>Cook the chicken:</h3></li>    
        <p>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.</p>
        <p>Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.</p>
        <p>Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.</p>
            <li><h3>Start Making the Sauce:</h3></li>
        <p>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.</p>
        <p>Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</p>
            <li><h3>Purée the sauce with the nuts:</h3></li>
        <p>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked, drained cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</p>
            <li><h3>Finish the dish:</h3></li>
        <p>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.</p>
        <p>As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
            <li><h3>Rest the butter chicken:</h3></li>
        <p>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</p>
            <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Serve the butter chicken with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for up to 5 days.</p>
        <p>You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</p>
