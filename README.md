# odin_recipes
This project is going to be a recipe website in which I utilise HTML to make the website. It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The skills that I will develop upon completion include :
-- Understanding of the Foundation of HTML.
-- How to make a good commit message which can help me become a better collaborator for the future(if i were to work with other developers).
-- Understanding of Git Basics.
